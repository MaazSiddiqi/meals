_A portal for popular dotfiles and dotfile snippets._

## About the project

The goal of the project is to build a convenient way of browsing, building, and sharing dotfiles.

Currently, my experience has been very manual and it would be very nice to have place to see "popular" snippets of configurations by the community. Much like awesome lists, but in a web interface. It would be really cool to have a way of just "piecing" together configurations from different sources and exporting it to your own dotfiles.

I recently got into ricing, and I think a hub like this would be very useful for new users to find and share configurations.

That's certainly an ambitious goal, and so I'm starting small with just browsing **neovim** configurations and snippets.

## Contributing

I'm not sure how I want to handle contributions yet, but I would love help! I'm building in a nextjs app, just because that's what I'm familiar with. I'm just building an mvp and will figure out how to formally handle contributions later.

Feel free to open an issue or a pr if you'd like to help!
